            <h2>Gear</h2>
            <p>All gear can be toggled when placed/dropped (may be bugged at the moment)</p>

            <h3>Camera</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Framing matters; center your reticule on the subject for a 3 star picture</li>
                <li>Tier 1 camera is always trackable for a ghost if equipped (?)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Candles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Burn themselves out</li>
                <li>Slows down sanity drain</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Crucifix</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Has a 3m range</li>
                <li>Used to prevent a hunt</li>
                <li>Will not shield or prevent an active hunt</li>
                <li>Can be held and walked through a ghost's spawn or dropped and placed at the spawn</li>
                <li>If a hunt is successfully prevented there is a 5 second delay before another can be attempted by the ghost</li>
                <li>One crucifix only has two uses</li>
                <li>Once fully used it will glow fully red and char the floor where it once laid</li>
                <li>Even if it's in the ghost room, if the crucifix is not in range the ghost can still hunt</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>D.O.T.S. Projector</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Interactions are every 30-60 seconds</li>
                <li>Ghosts must wander through them</li>
                <li>Displays ghosts' location and direction</li>
                <li>Ghost silhouette matches the ghost model</li>
                <li>DOTS photos count as ghost photos</li>
                <li>DOTS interactions give off EMF readings</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Motion Sensors work well with DOTS Projectors to track the ghost and shine their lights in its path.</p>

            <h3>EMF Reader</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 - Interacting with the environment (opening/closing a door, knocking a window, flicking a light switch, toggling the breaker, ringing a phone, etc)</li>
                <li>3 - Thrown object</li>
                <li>4 - Ghost event (flickering red lights, airball/hissing, light break)</li>
                <li>5 - 25% chance of occurring if evidence</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Incense</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6m range</li>
                <li>Prevents a hunt for 90 seconds</li>
                <li>During a hunt if used successfully the ghost will wander aimlessly for 6 seconds in which it can't attack at all</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sanity Medication</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increases sanity over 30 seconds (shorter times with Tiers II/III)</li>
                <li>Tier III meds give 10 secs of infinite sprint</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Sound Sensor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sounds now heard through them (Yurei's hissing can also be heard)</li>
                <li>Toggleable radius in the van</li>
                <li>Limited to the floor they're placed on</li>
                <li>Useful in hunts for anybody in the van</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spirit Box</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Seems hit or miss on latest patch (August 2023)</li>
                <li>Only a vocal response counts as evidence</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tier 1: Red light indicates the ghost hears your response</li>
                <li>Tier 2: X on screen indicates the ghost hears your response</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Thermometer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Freezing temps are below 0C</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Cold temps are visible below 5C.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Cursed Objects</h2>
            <p>Only 1 cursed object will ever spawn every job (0 on Insanity). Each cursed object has a single fixed spawn on every map. Each object has a 1 in 6 chance of being chosen for the job.</p>

                <li>If closer than 5m to the ghost, it will manifest and walk to the box</li>
                <li>Cursed hunt conditions: Ghost touches the box, walks for more than 5 seconds or dropped while playing</li>
                <li>Drains up to 73% sanity based on length of song heard and distance from the box</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Haunted Mirror</h3>

            <h3>Ouija Board</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>Summons the ghost in its full form (Shades appear as transparent shadows)</li>
                <li>Ghost remains motionless for 1-6 seconds before starting a cursed hunt from the circle</li>
                <li>Forces a hunting ghost to the circle if lit, hunt is extended 20 secs and ghost is free to immediately roam</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tarot Cards</h3>
            <ul>

                <li>The Tower: Triggers an interaction</li>
                <li>The Wheel of Fortune: Raises/decreases sanity by 25% if card burns green/red</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> All cards turn into 'The Fool' if drawn during a hunt.</p>

            <h3>Voodoo Doll</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Forces the ghost to interact with the environment per pin</li>
                <li>10 pins available to interact with</li>

            <h2>Ghosts</h2>

            <h3>Banshee</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unique scream noise on Parabolic Microphones</li>
                <li>Increased chance of singing ghost events that drain 15% sanity</li>
                <li>Chooses a single player as its target for the whole job</li>
                <li>Hunts based on their target's sanity, ignores every other player entirely during hunts</li>
                <li>Roams to targets outside of hunts for ghost events without leaving EMF 2</li>
                <li>Also roams to target when on D.O.T.S.</li>
                <li>Hunts normally if their target leaves the area or dies</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Demon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity threshold of 70%</li>
                <li>Rare chance of hunting at any sanity</li>
                <li>Cursed objects drain 20% less sanity than normal</li>
                <li>Crucifixes work within 5m of a Demon's current location</li>
                <li>20 seconds hunt cooldown (60 seconds after cleansing its area with incense)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Crucifixes area of effect are bigger than the 2m increase suggests. Weak crucifix placement can still prevent a Demon from hunting, and even give it away.</p>

            <h3>Deogen</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity threshold of 40%</li>
                <li>33% chance of responding to Spirit Box with heavy breathing if spoken to within 1m</li>
                <li>Cannot be hidden from</li>
                <li>Fast when far from any player, slow when near</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> NIGHTMARE/INSANITY: Spirit Box.</p>

            <h3>Goryo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only visible in a DOTS Projector through a video camera</li>
                <li>Never changes its ghost room</li>
                <li>Never roams far</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Watching the DOTS from an adjacent room with both your naked eye and a nearby video camera is a good way to test for a Goryo. NIGHTMARE/INSANITY: DOTS Projector</p>

            <h3>Hantu</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dependent on the breaker as power also controls the heating</li>
                <li>Cannot turn on the breaker</li>
                <li>Double chance of turning off the breaker</li>
                <li>Emits freezing breath in any room with a temp below 3C at any time, or in its ghost room when it begins a hunt with the breaker off</li>
                <li>Does not gradually speed up with line of sight. Hunt speed is affected by temperature:</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>15°C = 1.4 m/s</li>
                <li>12°C = 1.5 m/s</li>
                <li>9°C = 1.65 m/s</li>
                <li>6°C = 1.8 m/s</li>
                <li>3°C = 2.2 m/s</li>
                <li>0°C = 2.5 m/s</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> NIGHTMARE/INSANITY: Freezing temps. Dangerous in Camp Woodwind and Maple Lodge since the outdoor areas never warm up with the generator on. Loop near a lit campfire to slow it down.</p>

            <h3>Jinn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Breaker must be ON to activate its abilities</li>
                <li>Unable to directly turn off the breaker (can indirectly do so like other ghosts by flicking a light switch and resetting the breaker)</li>
                <li>Chance of suddenly dropping sanity by 25% if a player is nearby and leaves an EMF 2 reading on the breaker</li>
                <li>During a hunt the Jinn moves normally until it's within line of sight of a player, then it speeds up and then slows back down to normal speed once within 3m</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Long, narrow spaces where the Jinn can see you are ideal to test this. The Jinn will briefly speed up then slow down to normal speed, unlike a Deogen it won't speed around the map. Leave an EMF on a breaker and if it sounds off when the ghost is nowhere near, it's likely a Jinn.</p>

            <h3>Mare</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unable to turn light sources on</li>
                <li>Can turn a light source off IMMEDIATELY after it was turned on</li>
                <li>More likely to break lights</li>
                <li>Sanity threshold is 60/40% in bright/dark rooms</li>
                <li>More likely to wander away from bright rooms towards dark rooms (and change its ghost room on Nightmare/Insanity)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Moroi</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Curses players via Spirit Box or Parabolic Mic scream or footstep response</li>
                <li>Can curse all 4 players at once</li>
                <li>Cursed players lose sanity at double the normal rate (countering firelights)</li>
                <li>Leaving the area pauses the curse</li>
                <li>Sanity Medication cures the curse for that player (who can be re-cursed)</li>
                <li>Moroi becomes faster during hunts below 35% sanity</li>
                <li>At its fastest base speed of 2.25 m/s at 0% sanity, the Moroi can continue to speed up with line of sight to become faster than a Revenant (3.71 m/s)</li>
                <li>Incense blinds a hunting Moroi for 12 seconds</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Forcing a Moroi to hunt above 50% sanity with a cursed possession is a good way to test for its otherwise unseen slow speed. To distinguish from a Thaye, use sanity meds mid-hunt to slow the Moroi down. NIGHTMARE/INSANITY: Spirit Box.</p>

            <h3>Myling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Footsteps audible from only up to 12m away in a hunt</li>
                <li>Disrupts electronics from up to only 10m away in a hunt</li>
                <li>More likely to speak through the Para Mic</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> During a hunt listen for its footsteps fading in just after your electronics start to blink, and vice versa when they stop. Ghosts cannot disrupt electronics on other floors of a map, be careful not to mistake this quirk for a Myling. Can be confused with a Rajiu due to the Raiju's increased equipment disruption distance, check for speed in that case. The increased Para Mic usage can be misleading as other active ghosts can also spam the Para Mic.</p>

            <h3>Obake</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Only ghost that will sometimes not leave a fingerprint (25% chance)</li>
                <li>Rare 1/6 chance of leaving a unique 6 fingered fingerprint</li>
                <li>Fingerprints only last 50% as long</li>
                <li>Rare chance (6.66% per every blink) of switching to another ghost model during a hunt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If the ghost doesn't leave a fingerprint, then one shows up later it is very likely an Obake. Female ghosts can change to a smaller model that may not be visible due to it crawling, misleading players to suspect a Phantom. NIGHTMARE/INSANITY: Fingerprints.</p>

            <h3>Oni</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Very active ghost events</li>
                <li>Cannot do air ball ghost event</li>
                <li>Ghost events drop 20% sanity</li>
                <li>Blinks fast (0.1-0.5 secs) during hunts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Onryo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity threshold of 60% (standard 50% if firelights are near it)</li>
                <li>Cannot hunt within 4m of a fire</li>
                <li>Higher chance of blowing out an ingiter or firelight</li>
                <li>Will hunt after blowing out its 3rd firelight. 4th, 5th and so on have a smaller chance of triggering a hunt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Light a candle ON TOP of a crucifix, the Onryo will always blow out the candle BEFORE using the crucifix.</p>

            <h3>Phantom</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Becomes invisible during ghost events if photographed</li>
                <li>Roams to a random player for ghost events (leaves EMF 2)</li>
                <li>Blinks slower (1-2 seconds) during hunts, making it less visible</li>
                <li>Drains sanity twice as fast as normal when seen in ghost events</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Poltergeist</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Interacts with multiple objects at once</li>
                <li>Thrown objects drain 2% sanity (per object thrown) of anyone nearby</li>
                <li>Throws objects aggressively during a hunt (100% chance every 0.5 secs instead of 1 sec)</li>
                <li>Every single throw carries more velocity than usual</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Object piles are the best test for a Poltergeist. This can cause massive sanity drain all at once so be careful. If multiple items suspected, pick one up and move it away. If EMF still lingers you could be dealing with a poltergeist. Poltergeist throws create activity spikes on the monitor. Be careful not to mix up rebounding objects with a poltergeist throw.</p>

            <h3>Raiju</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity threshold of 65% when near electronic equipment</li>
                <li>Disrupts electronic equipment from up to 15m during a hunt</li>
                <li>Speeds up when near electronic equipment during a hunt</li>
                <li>Does not speed up with line of sight during a hunt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Only equipment that is switched on (EMF, Paramic, Spirit Box) or placed (DOTS, photo/video cameras) will speed up a Raiju. Moves at 2.5 m/s near electronics. If chased in a hunt, turn off your equipment and avoid others placed in the map to escape. Generally speaking EMF 5 + Ghost Orb usually confirms a Rajiu on Nightmare.</p>

            <h3>Revenant</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Roams at 50% the speed of normal ghosts</li>
                <li>Chases at 200% with line of sight on a player (3 m/s)</li>
                <li>If lost mid-hunt, it will maintains this speed until it reaches player's last known location</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Turn off electronics in a chase (esp flashlight) to negate its lingering speed, giving you time to slip away.</p>

            <h3>Shade</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sanity threshold of 35%</li>
                <li>66% chance of showing up as a shadow during ghost events. Only ghost to possibly appear as a shadow if summoned through monkey paw, music or summing circle</li>
                <li>Initially shy ghosts unlikely to interact with their environment</li>
                <li>Less likely to do visible ghost events (prefers airball/hissing events)</li>
                <li>Does not do interactions that results in EMF 2, 3 or 5 with someone in the same room (except writing and blowing out firelights)</li>
                <li>Will not hunt with someone in the same room. (OUTDATED?)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> For every 1% of average sanity lost, ghost event chance is increased by 2% (capped at 100%).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>100% average sanity = 0% chance</li>
                <li>75% average sanity = 50% chance</li>
                <li>50% average sanity = 100% chance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Spirit</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>180 seconds hunt cooldown after smudging its area instead of 90</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Thaye</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Upon entering the map a Thaye will start a 1-2 min timer, checking if a player is nearby at 0. If so, it ages up</li>
                <li>Once aged up the 1-2 timer resets. If not, the Thaye will check for a player in its room every 30 secs</li>
                <li>With each aging instance (up to 10 per contract) the Thaye's sanity threshold will lower (75%-15%), speed lowers (2.75-1m/s) and interaction lowers (200%-50%)</li>
                <li>Ouija Board and Spirit Box can be used to detect rising age</li>
                <li>More likely to interact with DOTS and Ghost Books</li>
                <li>Does not speed up on line of sight with a player</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Writing + DOTS on Nightmare usually confirms Thaye.</p>

            <h3>The Mimic</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can mimic the ability of every other ghost (besides Goryo's DOTS ability)</li>
                <li>Mimicked abilities change between hunts</li>
                <li>Always provides Ghost Orbs (even on 0 evidence)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When mimicking a Thaye's aging ability it will choose a random value. The Mimic can mimic itself or a player, leading to normal 'blank slate' ghost behaviour. AMATUER-PROFESSIONAL: Freezing Temps, Fingerprints, Spirit Box + Ghost Orb. NIGHTMARE: 2 pieces of evidence + Ghost Orb. INSANITY: 1 piece of evidence + Ghost Orb</p>

            <h3>The Twins</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A ghost with two separate interaction ranges</li>
                <li>Main interactions occur in the ghost room as normal (3m)</li>
                <li>Decoy interactions have a far bigger range and can occur in adjacent rooms (16m)</li>
                <li>50% chance of the main ghost hunting from the ghost room, moving at 90% speed</li>
                <li>50% chance of the decoy hunting from its last interaction, moving at 110% speed</li>
                <li>Can do 2 interactions at the same time (i.e. a door is opened, then within 0.5 seconds a far item is thrown)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> If a ghost seems active in a room but only ever gives EMF 5, you're not in the right room and it is likely a Twin. Activity bar can give the Twins away; the bar will rise sharply, then immediately rise again without plateuing. Twins' decoy range is very obvious on small maps.</p>

            <h3>Wraith</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot step in salt at all (also cannot be slowed down with Tier 3 Salt in a hunt)</li>
                <li>Can teleport to a player (within 3m) and interact from their new position. Always gives random EMF 2 reading when this happen!</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Lurk far from the known ghost room and if given a random EMF 2, it's likely a Wraith. Setting a Motion Sensor near some salt is a good way to test for Wraiths.</p>

            <h3>Yokai</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot detect equipment, voices or the music box from over 2.5m away (even during a hunt)</li>
                <li>Talking near the Yokai can make it hunt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Yokais are easier to lose in a hunt due to this ability.</p>

            <h3>Yurei</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Incense traps them inside their room for 60 seconds</li>
                <li>Can drop sanity of anyone within 7.5m by ~15% and close a door in the room during a hunt</li>
                <li>Only ghost to interact with the exit door outside of a hunt or ghost event</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Motion sensors outside the ghost room can hint at a Yurei if it triggers them after burning incense.</p>

            <h2>Point Hope</h2>
            <h3>Hiding</h3>
            <p>Each floor after the bottom floor has a central LOS break; however this is less reliable than vehicles in a garage such as Tanglewood.</p>

            <h4>Upon entry of the living area there are three immediate hiding spots:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediately to the right, behind the front door</li>
                <li>Shower in the bathroom on the left upon entry</li>
                <li>Upon entry to the lighthouse tower itself on the left before entry to the actual building</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Upon entry of the lighthouse itself:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Immediately to the right is a small lighthouse play house (this operates like a tent and requires crouching to enter)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Breaker spots:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Outside the bathroom within the lighthouse</li>
                <li>Wrapped outside on the wall on the stairwell to the right as the player goes upwards</li>
